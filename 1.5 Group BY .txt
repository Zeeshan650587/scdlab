-- SQL File: group_by_clause_queries.sql

-- Definition:
-- The GROUP BY clause is used in SQL to group rows that have the same values in specified columns.
-- It is often used with aggregate functions such as COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, and MIN to perform calculations on grouped data.
-- The GROUP BY clause follows the WHERE clause and precedes the ORDER BY clause in a SQL query.

-- Basic GROUP BY usage
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) AS employee_count 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department_id; -- Counts the number of employees in each department

-- Using GROUP BY with SUM
SELECT department_id, SUM(salary) AS total_salary 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department_id; -- Calculates total salary per department

-- Using GROUP BY with AVG
SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS average_salary 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department_id; -- Calculates average salary per department

-- Using GROUP BY with MIN and MAX
SELECT department_id, MIN(salary) AS min_salary, MAX(salary) AS max_salary 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department_id; -- Retrieves the minimum and maximum salary in each department

-- Using GROUP BY with multiple columns
SELECT department_id, job_title, COUNT(*) AS employee_count 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department_id, job_title; -- Groups by department and job title, counting employees in each combination

-- Using GROUP BY with HAVING to filter grouped results
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) AS employee_count 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department_id 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5; -- Retrieves departments with more than 5 employees

-- Using GROUP BY with ORDER BY
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) AS employee_count 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department_id 
ORDER BY employee_count DESC; -- Groups employees by department and sorts the result by employee count in descending order

-- Using GROUP BY with a subquery
SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary 
FROM employees 
WHERE department_id IN (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE department_name LIKE 'IT%') 
GROUP BY department_id; -- Calculates the average salary for departments whose names start with 'IT'

-- Using GROUP BY with CASE for conditional grouping
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN salary < 50000 THEN 'Low Salary'
        WHEN salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 100000 THEN 'Medium Salary'
        ELSE 'High Salary'
    END AS salary_category, 
    COUNT(*) AS employee_count 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY salary_category; -- Groups employees based on salary ranges and counts them
